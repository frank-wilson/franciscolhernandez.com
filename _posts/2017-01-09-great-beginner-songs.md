With enough practice, you can learn any song, even the more difficult ones like [Van Halen's "Eruption"](https://youtu.be/sI7XiJgt0vY), but such an advanced song will take a beginner a long time to master. That's why I would like to suggest a few lists of songs that help beginners with the difficult learning curve. When you are finished with this list, you will notice that learning advanced songs will take less time. 

If you are starting out fresh with guitar, I recommend these easy songs:

* Happy Birthday
* Jingle Bells
* Amazing Grace (melody only)
* Can Can
* Ode to Joy

Or small snippets of popular songs:

* Sweet Child O' Mine - Guns N' Roses(intro)
* Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne (intro)
* Smoke on the Water (intro)
* Iron Man - Black Sabbath (intro)
* One - Metallica (intro)
* Enter Sandman - Metallica (intro)
* Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes (intro)
* Today - Smashing Pumpkins (intro)
* Reptilia - New Hit Song

You can also include songs that have easy parts in them. 

Here's [Enter Sandman by Metallica](https://youtu.be/CD-E-LDc384):

[Iron Man by Paranoid](https://youtu.be/Uctu1e353os):

It's important to play easy melodies because you first need to build dexterity and learn how to read tablature. You'll also want to learn how to position your fingers accurately onto the frets and strum the correct strings. I also included some fun songs with power chords, which are two note chords.


If you feel like the first list is too easy, try this list:

* I Ran (So Far Away) - A Flock of Seagulls
* Do I Wanna Know? - Arctic Monkeys
* Push it to the Limit - Paul Engemann
* Zombie - Cranberries
* Down Under - Men At Work
* Safety Dance - Men Without Hats
* Eye of the Tiger - Survivor
* Iron Man - Black Sabbath
* Paranoid - Black Sabbath (excluding solo)
* So Whatcha Want - Beastie Boys
* PDA - Interpol
* My Own Worst Enemy - Lit
* A Certain Shade of Green - Incubus
* Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana
* Lithuim - Nirvana
* Toxicity- System of a Down
* Self Esteem - The Offspring
* Sex on Fire - Kings of Leon
* Message in a Bottle - The Police
* Blitzkreig Bop - The Ramones
* All Star - Smash Mouth
* I Wanna Be Sedated - The Ramones
* Hungry Like The Wolf - Duran Duran
* The Man Who Sold the World - David Bowie
* Seven Nation Army - The White Stripes
* Mr. Brightside - The Killers
* Today - Smashing Pumpkins

Once you get to this level, you'll be able to play a decent amount of songs. 

You'll also notice that some hard songs have an easy intro like ["Stariway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2EuPRAMZUY), so you can go ahead and learn that part. These songs require a little more dexterity and they all include power chords.  These songs are meant to introduce some basic techniques like palm muting from "Eye of the Tiger", crescendo which is an increase in volume, and hammer-ons and pull offs.


Here's a list with a somewhat intermediate difficulty: 

* Take On Me - A-ha
* Snow - Red Hot Chilli Peppers
* Hypnotize - System of a Down
* Soul Sister - Train (transcribed for Guitar)
* Pride and Joy - Stevie Ray Vaughn
* Hotel California - Eagles
* Thunderstruck - AC/DC (intro)
* Eruption - Van Halen (finger tapping part)
* Nothing Else Matters - Metallica (rhythm guitar)
* You Give Love A Bad Name - Bon Jovi
* Cult of Personlity - Living Colour
* Man in the Box - Alice in Chains
* Float On - Modest Mouse
* The Pretender - Foo Fighters
* BYOB - System of a Down
* Suite Pee - System of a Down
* Kryptonite - Three Doors Down
* Psycho Killer- Talking Heads
* White Wedding - Billy Idol
* Dead of Alive - Bon Jovi
* Last Resort - Papa Roach
* Chop Suey - System of a Down

When you are on this level, you can play most alternative songs. 

More techniques are introduced like bending, sliding, vibrato, alternate picking, and natural harmonics. Songs like "Take On Me" simply have you practice chords.


Here's an intermediate list: 

* La Grange - ZZTop
* Pinball Wizard - The Who
* Carry On My Wayward Son - Kansas
* Everlong - Foo Fighters
* Reptilia - The Strokes
* Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd
* Welcome Home - Coheed and Cambria
* Dream On - Aerosmith
* ...And Justice for All - Metallica (rhythm guitar)
* Battery - Metallica (rhythm guitar)
* Master of Puppets - Metallica (rhythm guitar)
* Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen
* Rebel Yell - Billy Idol
* Roundabout - Yes
* Tears in Heaven - Eric Clapton

If you are on this level, you can play pretty much any alternative song and any song that have simple solos.

There are a variety of techniques that are introduced here and almost all the songs are fast-paced, playable and popular. I am also currently on this level.


You'll notice that each category increases in speed, so you'll need more and more dexterity the farther you go down the list. There will be several techniques included for each song, further buiding your guitar skills. In the future, I hope to update this list more so that learning the guitar will be smoother. The important thing is that you practice a lot, build up your playlist, and learn new techniques. I hope this list helps with the difficulty curve and add more your playlist.
