You might be interested in learning the guitar, but either can't have enough time for it or don't know where to start.

First, if you don't have a guitar, go ahead and buy one. It's important to have your own instead of having to borrow from someone, because if you have a busy or erratic schedule, your guitar will always be available. If you buy an electric guitar, you might want an amplifier for its distinct sound. Extra effects like distortion pedals can give it the rock-and-roll sound. Alternatively, acoustic guitars have their own crisp sound. 

Once you have a guitar, there are many ways to go about learning it:

One of the most obvious methods is to get a guitar instructor. Depending on the instructor, it will usually end with great results because you can learn fundamentals, musical notation, and techniques. This is great, but it's expensive because guitar lessons are $20-$45 per hour depending on the instructor. Professionals might ask for more than $100 per hour. You might also have a friend that is available to teach you for free. The only problem there is that your friend might not always be available to teach you.

There is a game called Rocksmith made to help beginners learn guitar for the Xbox One, Playstation 4, and PC. If your guitar has an output jack, you connect your guitar with the console and you practice through the guitar songs and slowly progress to mastery. They also include helpful guitar lessons for techniques that you can use in the middle of a song. Although buying the console, the Rocksmith game, and the connection altogether is pretty expensive, it's a one time payment which is cheaper than the previous method. However, your favorite song might not be in their library, but if you practice with this software enough, your skills can be used to play your favorite song once you learn guitar tablature.

When you can only buy a guitar or borrow one, one way to learn is simply by practicing your favorite song over and over again until you reach mastery. I recommend starting off with easier songs like "Happy Birthday" just to add some dexterity. Then you can slowly increase difficulty before playing something like Joe Satriani's ["Surfing with the Alien"](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_ZQoQnI2o). Before you do this, you will need learn how to read tablature, which is a form of musical notation that shows how to perform the song. You might need a few pointers about some guitar techniques and fundamentals, but they are readily available on the internet. Additionally, it would be helpful to buy a book on learning guitar, which will help you learn the fundamentals and some basic techniques as well as musical notation like standard notation, which is the notation that all instruments use, and guitar tablature. This is the most affordable method.

A combination of these three methods would solidify your guitar fundamentals. However, the most important requirement to learn guitar is persistence. You'll have a difficult start with learning the guitar, but you must continue despite how frustrating it is. Once you pass that difficult learning curve, you'll enjoy the benefits of guitar mastery.
