You might be interested in learning the guitar, but don't know where to start.

Learning from a guitar instructor usually yields great results. The instructor guides you through fundamentals, musical notation, and technique. However, it may be too expensive if you have a low budget, as guitar lessons may cost $20-$40 per hour.

Then there are console games like Rocksmith, which combines guitar learning and rhythm games. This software helps you develop skills while simultaneously teaching you how to play your favorite song. This makes it a practical and easy method of learning guitar, provided you already have the console and money for the software and its adapter. The advantage here is once you have all of the equipment, you wont need to pay anything else, for the exception of downloadable content.

But at the minimum, you only really need a guitar. You can play through your favorite songs and search the internet for guidance. Thousands of tutorials on guitar techinques are readily available on youtube. I recommend playing easier songs first to get used to your guitar and then slowly increase difficulty. And online guitar tablature can help you learn your favorite songs.

Guitar mastery requires consisteny and patience. Mastering the guitar can take years since the learning curve is steep. It will be a grind, but once you have enough dexterity and technique, you can play anything.
